## Current Mirrors
1. Introduction
A current mirror is a circuit that copies (mirrors) a reference current to another branch while maintaining a constant current despite variations in voltage. It is widely used in biasing circuits, analog IC design, and active loads in amplifiers.
### Design and analyze current mirror circuit as load active in amplifier circuit
#### Circuit 1
Circuit Parameters: gain<= -10V/V   Vdd = 1.8V

I_total = I_ref + I_x
I_total = P/Vdd
#### Design for Current mirror 1:1 ratio
I_Ref = I_x = 0.277mA
