# Monostable Multivibrator Using 555 Timer IC

## Aim
Generate a waveform with pulse width of **0.5 ms** under different trigger conditions using **555 timer IC**.

---

## Theory

A **monostable multivibrator**, also known as a one-shot pulse generator, produces a single pulse of fixed duration in response to an external trigger signal. The 555 timer IC is a versatile chip used in this configuration to generate precise time delays.

In monostable mode:
- The output remains **LOW** until triggered.
- Once triggered, the output goes **HIGH** for a specific time period `T`, then returns to **LOW**.
- This duration `T` is determined by an external resistor and capacitor using the formula:
T = 1.1 √ó R √ó C

To achieve a pulse width of **0.5 ms**:

Choose suitable values of **R** and **C**, for example:
- R = 4.5 kŒ©
- C = 0.1 ¬µF

Then:
T = 1.1 √ó 4500 √ó 0.1√ó10‚Åª‚Å∂ = 0.495 ms ‚âà 0.5 ms

## Working

- When the trigger pin (pin 2) receives a LOW signal (<1/3 Vcc), the timer starts timing.
- The output (pin 3) goes HIGH for the duration `T = 1.1RC`.
- After the time `T` elapses, the output returns to LOW.
- Re-triggering is only possible after the pulse ends.

## Trigger Conditions Tested

|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Manual trigger using push button | Output pulse of 0.5 ms observed     |
| Trigger from square wave generator | Output pulse of 0.5 ms per trigger |
| Trigger during HIGH output    | No effect until output goes LOW      |

## Output Waveform

Simulations were performed using a pulse source (`VTrig`) with varying parameters to test the monostable response.

###  Case 1: Properly Spaced Triggers

**Trigger Pulse Source:**
VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 2m)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 52 04_2cadc49e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3620b6f3-937b-4caa-892d-f4f608936627)

- Generates a falling edge every **2 ms**.
- Simulation Time: **10 ms**

**Expected Results:**

- Each falling edge successfully triggers the 555 timer.
- The output (`VOUT`) goes HIGH for ~0.5 ms per trigger.
- Multiple distinct output pulses are generated.

**Waveforms:**

1. **Trigger Input (VTrig)**: Periodic 2 ms LOW pulses.
2. **Capacitor Voltage (VC)**: Shows charge/discharge profile.
3. **Output (VOUT)**: Series of 0.5 ms HIGH pulses.

### üîπ Case 2: Rapid Repeated Triggers

**Trigger Pulse Source:**
VTrig PULSE(5 0 0.05m 0 0 0.01m 0.2m)

- Generates a falling edge every **0.2 ms** (faster than output duration).
- Simulation Time: **2 ms**

**Expected Results:**

- Only the **first falling edge** triggers the timer.
- Output (`VOUT`) remains HIGH for 0.5 ms.
- Subsequent triggers during the HIGH period are **ignored**.
- Only **one output pulse** is generated.

**Waveforms:**
1. **Trigger Input (VTrig)**: Fast repetitive pulses.
2. **Capacitor Voltage (VC)**: Single charge/discharge cycle.
3. **Output (VOUT)**: Single 0.5 ms HIGH pulse.

|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Properly spaced triggers    | Multiple 0.5 ms pulses                 |
| Rapid repeated triggers     | Single 0.5 ms pulse, others ignored    |

##  Applications

- Pulse stretching
- Debouncing mechanical switches
- Delay generation in digital circuits
- Frequency-to-time conversion

---

##  Conclusion

The monostable multivibrator using the 555 Timer IC was successfully simulated and tested. Under well-spaced triggers, each falling edge initiates a 0.5 ms pulse. In rapid trigger conditions, only the first falling edge is acknowledged, validating the one-shot pulse behavior.

##  Theory

###  555 Timer in Astable Mode

- Generates continuous square wave (no external trigger required).
- Output oscillates between HIGH and LOW indefinitely.

Formulas:
- `T_ON = 0.693 √ó (R1 + R2) √ó C`
- `T_OFF = 0.693 √ó R2 √ó C`
- `T_PERIOD = T_ON + T_OFF`

###  555 Timer in Monostable Mode

- Generates a single output pulse of fixed duration on every trigger.
- Pulse width `T = 1.1 √ó R √ó C`

---

##  Calculations

###  Case 1: `T_ON = 0.3 ms`, `T_OFF = 0.2 ms`

- Period = `0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5 ms`
- Frequency = `1 / 0.5 ms = 2 kHz`

Assume:  
- C = 0.01 ¬µF  
From `T_ON = 0.693 √ó (R1 + R2) √ó C`, we get:
0.3 ms = 0.693 √ó (R1 + R2) √ó 0.01√ó10‚Åª‚Å∂
=> R1 + R2 ‚âà 43.26 kŒ©

From `T_OFF = 0.693 √ó R2 √ó C`:

0.2 ms = 0.693 √ó R2 √ó 0.01√ó10‚Åª‚Å∂
=> R2 ‚âà 28.87 kŒ©
=> R1 ‚âà 14.39 kŒ©

>  **Use:** R1 = 14.4 kŒ©, R2 = 28.9 kŒ©, C = 0.01 ¬µF

---

###  Case 2: `T_ON = 0.7 ms`, `T_OFF = 0.3 ms`

- Period = `0.7 + 0.3 = 1.0 ms`
- Frequency = `1 / 1.0 ms = 1 kHz`

Assume C = 0.01 ¬µF again:

0.7 ms = 0.693 √ó (R1 + R2) √ó 0.01√ó10‚Åª‚Å∂
=> R1 + R2 ‚âà 100.99 kŒ©

0.3 ms = 0.693 √ó R2 √ó 0.01√ó10‚Åª‚Å∂
=> R2 ‚âà 43.29 kŒ©
=> R1 ‚âà 57.70 kŒ©

>  **Use:** R1 = 57.6 kŒ©, R2 = 43.3 kŒ©, C = 0.01 ¬µF
> 
###  Case 3: `T_ON = 0.4 ms`, `T_OFF = 0.1 ms`, `T = 0.5 ms`
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 53 47_69d26ff7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a09959e9-298a-4230-8987-634d2b1778af)

Assume C = 0.01 ¬µF  
- `R1 + R2 = 57.69 kŒ©`  
- `R2 = 14.43 kŒ©` ‚Üí `R1 ‚âà 43.26 kŒ©`

> Used: R1 = 43.2 kŒ©, R2 = 14.4 kŒ©, C = 0.01 ¬µF

**Inverted Output:**
Using the transistor inverter (Figure 2), we invert this waveform:
- Inverted `T_ON = 0.1 ms`  
- Inverted `T_OFF = 0.4 ms`

This gives a falling edge trigger with:
- Enough time for monostable reset
- Reliable trigger edge separation

##  Output Waveform Observations

###  Case 1 (T = 0.5 ms)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 53 11_10e9921b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806c7d61-234c-48ee-ad3f-cf44efe010fd)

- Astable output toggles every 0.5 ms (0.3 ms ON, 0.2 ms OFF).
- Each falling edge triggers the monostable multivibrator.
- Monostable generates a **0.5 ms pulse** per trigger.
- Output waveform is a series of 0.5 ms pulses aligned with each trigger.

###  Case 2 (T = 1.0 ms)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 53 26_3e34c3b1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/789ec5bb-891e-4e27-9021-5d3fceb7fe97)

- Astable output toggles every 1.0 ms (0.7 ms ON, 0.3 ms OFF).
- Fewer trigger pulses due to slower frequency.
- Monostable output still maintains 0.5 ms pulse per trigger.

###  Case 3 (with inverter)
![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-27 at 06 54 05_bb49e532](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91fb1b97-f6d8-4d1c-be46-e29db839ca57)

- Trigger pulse: `0.1 ms HIGH`, `0.4 ms LOW`
- Falling edges spaced by 0.5 ms
- Monostable has sufficient time to return to LOW before next pulse

---

##  Conclusion

The circuit successfully demonstrates:
- Generation of clock pulses using astable multivibrator.
- Controlled pulse width generation using monostable multivibrator.
- Flexible waveform shaping by tuning R and C values.
